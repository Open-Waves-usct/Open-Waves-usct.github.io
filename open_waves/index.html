        <h1>Welcome to OpenWaves</h1>
        <p>We present OpenWaves, a large-scale wave equation dataset designed to bridge the
            gap between theoretical equations and practical imaging applications. OpenWaves
            provides over 16 million frequency-domain wave simulations using real USCT (Ultrasound-CT)
            configurations, featuring anatomically realistic human breast phantoms across four
            categories as figure below. It enables comprehensive benchmarking of popular neural operators
            for both forward simulation and inverse imaging tasks, allowing analysis of their
            performance, scalability, and generalization capabilities. By offering a realistic
            and extensive dataset, OpenWaves not only serves as a platform for developing
            innovative neural PDE solvers but also facilitates their deployment in real-world
            medical imaging problems.</p>
